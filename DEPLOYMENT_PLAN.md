# Bull Horn Analytics: From Development to Deployment

This document outlines a comprehensive plan to take your Bull Horn Analytics application from its current state to a successful production deployment.

## Project Overview

- **Frontend:** React, Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- **Routing:** React Router
- **State Management:** Tanstack Query for server state
- **Backend:** Supabase (Auth, Database with migrations, Edge Functions)
- **Deployment Model:** Static frontend (Vite build output) with a dynamic backend (Supabase).

## Phase 1: Local Development & Refinement

*Goal: Solidify features, ensure code quality, and prepare for production.*

#### 1.1. Code Quality & Consistency
- [ ] **Linting:** Run `npm run lint` and fix all errors. Ensure ESLint is integrated into your IDE for real-time feedback.
- [ ] **Formatting:** Run `npm run format:fix` to ensure consistent code style with Prettier.
- [ ] **Type Safety:** Run `npm run typecheck` and resolve any TypeScript errors. Add types for any parts of the application that are still using `any`.

#### 1.2. Component & UI Polish
- [ ] **Review `shadcn/ui` components:** Ensure they are used consistently.
- [ ] **Theming:** Finalize your light/dark mode themes in `tailwind.config.ts`.
- [ ] **Responsiveness:** Test the application on various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile). Address any layout issues.

#### 1.3. Environment Variables
- [ ] Create a `.env.production` file for production-specific environment variables.
- [ ] Your application likely uses a `.env.local` for development. Ensure your Supabase URL and anon key are stored there. **NEVER** commit these files to version control. Your `.gitignore` file should include `.env*`.
- [ ] **Code Check:** Verify that you are using `import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` in your Supabase client setup.

#### 1.4. Testing
- [ ] **Unit Tests:** Write unit tests for critical business logic, utility functions, and complex components. Use `vitest`.
- [ ] **Integration Tests:** Test how components work together. For example, test the login flow, or creating a new product.
- [ ] **Run all tests:** `npm run test` and ensure they all pass.

## Phase 2: Supabase Backend Hardening

*Goal: Ensure the Supabase backend is secure, scalable, and ready for production traffic.*

#### 2.1. Environments
- Supabase recommends using separate projects for "development" and "production".
- [ ] If you haven't already, create a new Supabase project for your production environment.
- [ ] Apply your database migrations to the production project using the Supabase CLI: `supabase db push`.

#### 2.2. Security
- [ ] **Row Level Security (RLS):** Review and test all your RLS policies. The `user_management_policy.sql` is a good start. Ensure that users can only access their own data.
- [ ] **Authentication:**
    - Enable email confirmations in Supabase Auth settings.
    - Customize the email templates.
    - Consider adding third-party providers (e.g., Google, GitHub) if needed.
- [ ] **Edge Functions:** Secure your edge functions. Ensure they validate user authentication and authorization.

#### 2.3. Database
- [ ] **Indexing:** Add database indexes to frequently queried columns to improve performance. Use `EXPLAIN` on your SQL queries to identify slow queries.
- [ ] **Backups:** Enable Point-in-Time-Recovery for your production Supabase project.

## Phase 3: Pre-Deployment & Testing

*Goal: Build the application for production, and run final tests in a staging environment.*

#### 3.1. Production Build
- [ ] Run `npm run build`. This will create a `dist/` directory with your optimized, production-ready frontend assets.
- [ ] Test the build locally by running `npm run start`. This will serve the `dist` folder. Make sure the application runs as expected.

#### 3.2. Staging Environment
- It's highly recommended to have a staging environment that mirrors production as closely as possible.
- **Hosting:** Deploy the contents of your `dist/` directory to a staging URL on a hosting provider like Vercel, Netlify, or AWS S3/Cloudfront.
- **Backend:** Connect this staging deployment to your *production* Supabase project (or a dedicated staging project if you have the resources).
- **Testing:**
    - [ ] Perform end-to-end (E2E) testing on the staging environment. You can use tools like Cypress or Playwright for this.
    - [ ] Share the staging URL with stakeholders for final review and user acceptance testing (UAT).

## Phase 4: Production Deployment

*Goal: Deploy the application to a hosting provider and go live.*

#### 4.1. Choosing a Host
- For a Vite/React static site, you have many excellent options:
    - **Vercel/Netlify:** Easiest to set up. They integrate directly with your Git repository (e.g., GitHub) and automatically build and deploy your site when you push changes.
    - **AWS S3 + CloudFront:** A powerful and scalable option. You would upload the `dist` folder to an S3 bucket and serve it via the CloudFront CDN.
    - **Other options:** Cloudflare Pages, Firebase Hosting, etc.

#### 4.2. Deployment Process (Example with Vercel/Netlify)
1.  Connect your Git repository to the hosting provider.
2.  Configure the build settings:
    - **Build Command:** `npm run build`
    - **Output Directory:** `dist`
3.  Add your production environment variables (e.g., `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`, `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`) in the hosting provider's dashboard.
4.  Trigger a deployment.

## Phase 5: Post-Deployment & Monitoring

*Goal: Monitor the application, gather feedback, and plan for future iterations.*

#### 5.1. Monitoring
- [ ] **Uptime Monitoring:** Use a service like UptimeRobot to get alerted if your site goes down.
- [ ] **Error Tracking:** Use a service like Sentry or LogRocket to track errors in your production application.
- [ ] **Analytics:** Use a tool like Google Analytics or Plausible to understand user behavior.

#### 5.2. Feedback & Iteration
- [ ] Establish a channel for users to report bugs and provide feedback.
- [ ] Use the data from your monitoring tools to identify areas for improvement.
- [ ] Plan your next development cycle based on user feedback and your product roadmap.
