# Project Finalization and Deployment Framework

This plan is broken down into four distinct phases:
1.  **Stabilization & Bug Squashing:** Fixing all current known issues to create a stable base.
2.  **Code Hardening & Refinement:** Improving code quality, security, and the user experience.
3.  **Testing & Documentation:** Ensuring the application is reliable and easy for others (or your future self) to maintain.
4.  **Final Deployment & Go-Live:** The final checklist for pushing to a production domain.

## Phase 1: Stabilize the Current Deployment (Bug Squashing)

*Goal: Address all known bugs to ensure every existing feature works as expected on the Vercel deployment.*

### 1.1. Resolve Core User Authentication Flow
*This is the most critical feature. We'll address the issues you deferred.*

* **Sub-step 1.1.1: Fix the User Creation Bug**
    * Investigate and resolve the `500 Internal Server Error` when creating a user.
    * **Action:** Confirm that the "Confirm email" toggle is OFF in your Supabase project's **Authentication -> Providers -> Email** settings. This is the most likely cause.
    * **Action:** If the error persists, it is likely due to a database trigger issue. Replace the `addUser` and `apiSignUp` functions in `src/lib/api.ts` with more robust versions that handle this case gracefully.

* **Sub-step 1.1.2: Test All User Creation Paths**
    * **Action:** Test the public "Create Account" page (`/signup`) and ensure a new user is created with the default `'cashier'` role.
    * **Action:** Log in as an admin and test the "Add User" feature on the `/users` page.

### 1.2. Fix API Key and Configuration Errors
*These errors are breaking key features on your dashboard and need to be resolved.*

* **Sub-step 1.2.1: Correctly Configure Google AI API Key**
    * **Action:** Resolve the `403 API_KEY_HTTP_REFERRER_BLOCKED` error. In your Google Cloud Console, edit your API key's "Website restrictions" to include the wildcard patterns `bha-2.vercel.app/*` and `bha-2-*.vercel.app/*`. This will ensure it works for your main domain and all Vercel preview deployments.

* **Sub-step 1.2.2: Fix Asset Loading Errors (Icons & Manifest)**
    * **Action:** Resolve the `404 Not Found` errors for your favicons. Ensure that `favicon.svg`, `favicon-16x16.png`, and `favicon-32x32.png` exist in your project's `public/` directory.
    * **Action:** Resolve the `401 Unauthorized` error for `site.webmanifest`. Ensure your `vercel.json` file contains the `"routes"` rule provided previously to correctly serve these public files.

## Phase 2: Code Hardening & Refinement

*Goal: Elevate the project from "working" to "professional" by focusing on security, quality, and user experience.*

### 2.1. Enhance Application Security
* **Sub-step 2.1.1: Review Row Level Security (RLS)**
    * **Action:** In the Supabase dashboard, go through each RLS policy on your `products`, `sales`, `sale_items`, and `users` tables. Ask yourself: "Can a user access data they shouldn't be able to?" For example, ensure a 'cashier' role cannot see another cashier's sales data if that's your business logic.

* **Sub-step 2.1.2: Strengthen the Content Security Policy (CSP)**
    * **Action:** In `vercel.json`, remove `'unsafe-inline'` and `'unsafe-eval'` from the `Content-Security-Policy` header. This is an advanced step that significantly improves security but may require you to refactor any inline styles or scripts to be loaded from files instead.

* **Sub-step 2.1.3: Secure the `deleteUser` Function**
    * **Action:** The current `deleteUser` function only removes a user from your `public.users` table, not from Supabase's authentication system. The correct way to do this is to create a Supabase Edge Function that uses the secret `service_role` key to delete the user from both places securely.

### 2.2. Improve Code Quality and UI/UX
* **Sub-step 2.2.1: Full Linting and Formatting Pass**
    * **Action:** Run `npm run lint` and `npm run format:fix` to clean up the entire codebase and ensure consistency.

* **Sub-step 2.2.2: Add Robust Loading and Error States**
    * **Action:** Audit every page that fetches data. Ensure that a loading indicator (like the `<LoadingSpinner />` or `<Skeleton />` components) is shown while data is being fetched.
    * **Action:** Ensure that if an API call fails, a user-friendly error message or alert is displayed instead of a crash or blank section.

## Phase 3: Testing and Documentation

*Goal: Ensure the application is reliable, bug-free, and maintainable.*

### 3.1. Comprehensive Testing
* **Sub-step 3.1.1: Write Unit Tests**
    * **Action:** For every function in `src/lib/utils.ts` and `src/lib/analytics.ts`, write corresponding tests in a `.spec.ts` file to ensure they work as expected. You already have good examples to follow.

* **Sub-step 3.1.2: Write Integration Tests**
    * **Action:** For each page, write tests that simulate user interactions. For example, for `Products.tsx`, write a test that clicks the "Add Product" button, fills out the form, and verifies that the new product appears in the table.

### 3.2. Project Documentation
* **Sub-step 3.2.1: Create a `README.md`**
    * **Action:** Create a high-quality `README.md` file at the root of your project. It should include a project description, a list of features, and clear instructions on how to set up the project for local development (e.g., how to create the `.env` file, what `npm` commands to run).

* **Sub-step 3.2.2: Document Environment Variables**
    * **Action:** Create a file named `.env.example`. Copy the contents of your `.env` file into it, but remove the secret values. This serves as a template for anyone setting up the project.
    * **Example `.env.example`:**
        ```
        VITE_SUPABASE_URL="YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL_HERE"
        VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY_HERE"
        VITE_GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"
        ```

## Phase 4: Final Deployment & Go-Live

*Goal: Launch the finalized application on a production domain.*

### 4.1. Production Git and Environment Setup
* **Sub-step 4.1.1: Create a Production Branch**
    * **Action:** In Git, create a new branch called `production` from your `main` branch. This branch will only contain stable, tested, and production-ready code.

* **Sub-step 4.1.2: Configure Vercel Deployment**
    * **Action:** In your Vercel project settings, change the "Production Branch" from `main` to `production`. Now, only pushes to this branch will update your main live site.

* **Sub-step 4.1.3: Add a Custom Domain**
    * **Action:** In the Vercel dashboard, go to **Settings -> Domains** and add your custom domain (e.g., `www.bullhornanalytics.com`).

### 4.2. Final Pre-Launch Audit
* **Sub-step 4.2.1: Clean Production Database**
    * **Action:** Remove all test users, products, and sales from your **production** Supabase project to start fresh for real users.

* **Sub-step 4.2.2: Final End-to-End Testing**
    * **Action:** On your final production URL, perform one last, complete run-through of every feature in the application.

* **Sub-step 4.2.3: Launch!**
    * **Action:** Merge your `main` branch into your `production` branch and push it. Vercel will deploy the final version to your custom domain. Congratulations!
